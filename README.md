# Task_05_Descriptive_Stats
This project is focused on and Large Language Models (LLMs) to a public dataset and we explore match-level statistics from the IPL 2025 season. The main aim is to check if LLM gives the same answers as Python does or gives different or takes more time or does calculation errors. I used Chatgpt as LLM.

So for this question LLM i used Chatgpt gave me the answer different answer i.e.
Q)	Is there a statistically significant advantage to bowling first vs. batting first?
P-value: 0.83 was provided by Chatgpt and python code gave me P-value: 0.7848 , even it doesnt change the final answer it remains as not statistically significant because of the (p > 0.05). 

In some of those Chatgpt provided results but took a bit longer then the python code.
For example , in the following question
Which city/venue saw the most closely contested matches (margin < 10 runs or < 2 wickets)?
Chatgpt took long and also gave the wrong answer at first.
